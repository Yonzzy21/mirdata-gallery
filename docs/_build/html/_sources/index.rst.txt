First, I attempt to detect possible misconceptions within the task, which is typically accomplished with a tonal vocabulary overly centred in Western classical tonality, reduced to a binary major/minor model which might not accomodate popular music styles. Second, I present a study of tonal practises in electronic dance music, developed hand in hand with the curation of a corpus of over 2,000 audio excerpts, including various subgenres and degrees of complexity. Based on this corpus, I propose the creation of more open-ended key labels, accounting for other modal practises and ambivalent tonal configurations. Last, I describe my own key finding methods, adapting existing models to the musical idiosyncrasies and tonal distributions of electronic dance music, with new statistical key profiles derived from the newly created corpus.},

* **Annotations:** ``BeatData``, ``NoteData``, ``EventData``


**About this dataset:**
   
The Jazz Trio Database (JTD) includes 1,294 multitrack jazz performances, with annotations for beat and downbeat timestamps, MIDI transcriptions, and onset timestamps for unmixed audio tracks, primarily for jazz piano trio performances. The dataset supports tasks like onset detection, beat tracking, and automatic transcription.

* **Downloadable Remotes:** ``annotations``
* **YAML File:** :download:`jtd.yaml<../dataset_yamls/jtd.yaml>`


.. admonition:: Download Instructions
   :class: dropdown
   

   To download the audio for files for JTD, visit: https://zenodo.org/records/13828030 and request access.

   After you've been granted access, press the "Download all" button on the Zenodo record.

   This will create a new file named files-archive (with no extension). Rename the file to files-archive.zip and extract 
   using any unzipping tool (7zip, WinRAR, the unarchiver) or the command line. This will give you a list of multi-part 
   zip files in the form [processed.zip.001, processed.zip.002, ...] and [raw.zip.001, raw.zip.002, ...]. 

   To extract these, use 7zip from the command line:

   ```
   7z x processed.zip.001
   7z x raw.zip.001
   ```

   Note that the default `unzip` command on Linux can't handle these files, so you'll need to use 7zip. You may also be 
   able to use a GUI tool like WinRAR, which was used to create the archive in the first place. 

   These commands will extract the audio to the current folder. You'll then need to move the results to {0}/processed and 
   {0}/raw, respectively, creating these folders if they don't already exist.

   Combined with the annotation files (which can be obtained by calling `.download()` on the `mirdata.Dataset` instance 
   you've just initialized), the end result should be a file structure that looks like:

   ```
   {0}
   ├─ raw
   │  ├─ barronk-allgodschildren-drummondrrileyb-1990-8b77c067.wav    # one to three audio files per performance
